## 1. <a name="ProjectOverview">Project Overview </a>
The goal of the project is to apply data engineering skills to analyze the [Disaster Response Messages](https://www.figure-eight.com/dataset/combined-disaster-response-data/) dataset provided by Figure Eight, and build a web application that can help emergency workers analyze incoming messages and sort them into specific categories to speed up aid and contribute to more efficient distribution of people and other resources.

### 2. <a name="ProjectComponents">Project Components </a>
There are three components:

### 2.1. ETL Pipeline
This is a data cleaning pipeline, that:
- Load Messages and Categories csv datasets 
- Merge the two datasets
- Clean the data
- Save data into a SQLite database

### 2.2. ML Pipeline
This is a machine learning pipeline, that:
- Loads data from the SQLite database
- Splits the dataset into training and test sets
- Builds a text processing and machine learning pipeline
- Trains and tunes a model using GridSearchCV
- Outputs results on the test set
- Exports the final model as a pickle file

### 2.3. Flask Web App
A Web application that is built and run using Flask framework.

## 4. <a name="Instructions">Instructions </a>

1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to process data and train model.

    - Run the ETL pipeline to clean data and store it in a SQLite database
		```python
		python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/disasterMessage.db
		```
    - Run the ML pipeline to trains and tunes a model using GridSearchCV, and save the model
		```python    
        python models/train_classifier.py data/disasterMessage.db models/disasterClf.pickle
		```
2. Run your web app with the following command in the app's directory.

	python app/run.py
